## Transactions
 - Wallets are made up of a private and public RSA key
 - Addresses of wallets are created by hashing the PubKey into a hexadecimal format
 - within 10 sec of next block no transactions
 - transactions are validated every time next block is generated, if two transactions are generated from a wallet with insufficient funds the first will pass but the second wil not
